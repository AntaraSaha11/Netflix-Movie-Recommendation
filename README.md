Title: Movie Recommendation System Using Content Based Recommendation Algorithm.


Data Source: 
Kaggle – Netflix Movies & TV Shows, IMDB - Ratings, Movies, Names. 


Data Description: 
There are several datasets available to build a movie recommendation system. But for this project, we are going to use a dataset that contains 
the Netflix shows and movie data, along with their ratings in IMDB.


Motivation:
Wherever we want to watch latest movies or series mostly we go for popular streaming networks such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and so on. 
And there is such a wide variety of shows and movies available that everyone can find something they like. 
But when there are more than 14000 options, how would we choose one that we might like? 
In that case, Machine Learning can be a big help. 
There are many models of machine learning used by these streaming networks, among which the most popular is their content based recommendations system that 
helps us decide what we might like to watch.


Project Idea: 
Have you ever wondered how this streaming network recommends shows and movies based on your watching history? 
Do you wonder how they manages to find movies that is similar to the ones you’ve already watched? 
If you go to Netflix and check your movie recommendations! 
Are they the same as your friends? No, your movie recommendations are totally personalized to your tastes and based on what you might want to want. 
So, if you are a fan of horror movies, you might see more of the Witchy and Ghostly options while your friend may see cute love story options 
if they are a fan of rom coms. But how does Netflix decide this? 
They use their recommendations system that is based on a machine-learning algorithm that considers your past choices in movies, 
the types of genres you like, and what moves were watched by users that had similar tastes like yours. 
This movie recommendation algorithm is very important for Netflix, as they have thousands of options of all types and users, 
are more likely to get confused in choosing what to watch next than watching anything. 
Here the movie recommendation algorithm can provide a clear guideline and help in what to watch. And it’s your choice to follow it or not. 
If you are in the mood for watching Silence of the Lambs after Pride and Prejudice, then go for it!
